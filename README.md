<h1>Tube Companion :o</h1>

`This is a basic app made to check various aspects of the London Underground
as of now the features that it provides are very minimal
(a grand total of one...)`
<p>
  
  `The TUI of the app was made possible with
Textual. You can find the repository for it` [here](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)

</p>

  `Thanks to Transport For London for creating the Unified API
  (where it fetches the data)`
