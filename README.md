`This is a basic app made to check various aspects of the London Underground
as of now the features that it provides are very minimal

  `The TUI of the app was made possible with
Textual. You can find the repository for it` [here](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)

  `Thanks to Transport For London for creating the Unified API
  (where it fetches the data)`
